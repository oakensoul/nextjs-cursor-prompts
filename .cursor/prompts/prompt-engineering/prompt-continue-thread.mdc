# Thread Continuation and Context Transfer

**This prompt enables seamless context transfer between conversation threads by creating comprehensive summaries of completed work and identifying unfinished tasks, ensuring continuity and preventing loss of progress.**

## üéØ **THREAD CONTINUATION OBJECTIVES:**

1. **SUMMARIZE accomplished tasks** and deliverables from current thread
2. **IDENTIFY unfinished work** and next steps requiring continuation
